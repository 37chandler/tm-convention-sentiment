# Assignment: Convention Speaker Sentiment

The marching orders for this assignment are pretty straightforward. Using the 2020 Conventions database, 
assemble text for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Mike Pence, and Kamala Harris. We'll score the sentiment of
any nights where they spoke more than 1000 words (determined by the `text_len` column of the database). 

Your submission will be code that does the sentiment scoring as well as filling out this table below. I've 
created some rows to get you started, but you may need to add or subtract rows.

## Results

| Speaker  | Night  | Words  |  Sentiment Score | Positive % | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Example | 7 | 10000 | 200 | 2.0 | 
|  |  |  |  |  |
